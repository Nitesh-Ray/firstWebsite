                    `The simplest use for a Raspberry Pi is as a desktop computer.

                    Along with the Pi itself, the microSD card, and power supply, you'll need a HDMI cable and a suitable display. As with a traditional computer, you'll also need a USB keyboard and mouse. <br>
                    
                    The Raspberry Pi 3 and later has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth built in. If you're using an older model, you'll need compatible USB dongles (check compatibility at elinux.org's Raspberry Pi Hub). 
                    If you prefer to use Ethernet, however, all Raspberry Pi models (except the Pi Zero) are equipped with Ethernet ports.`

                    `One of the Raspberry Pi's most popular uses, the device is ideal as a retro gaming machine. <br> <br> After all, it's compact and powerful enough to be used in several different ways. Not least to fit it as one of the lightest components of a full-sized arcade machine or as a Game Boy kit!`

                    `Thanks to various ports (from USB to GPIO) the Raspberry Pi can integrate and interface with many other devices. One of the most interesting options is a model trainset. <br><br>

                    Wouldn't it be awesome to control your model railroad with a Raspberry Pi? Several projects have been developed that enable this. They're scalable projects that can do everything from monitor the position of trains and adjust speed, to controlling points, lights, and even the ambience of the accompanying model village.`

                    Another fantastic use for a Raspberry Pi is to set it up as a web server. This basically means that it can be configured to host a website. It might host your blog, for example.

                    <br><br> Several methods can be used. You'll need to get started by installing the right software: Apache and its associated libraries. Or you might install a full LAMP stack, with PHP and MySQL alongside Apache. It's useful if you also set up FTP.
